When starting the program make sure you have directX compatible graphic card.

1. For some reason GUI elements do not display when opening the application so you need to move the window in order to see them.
2. To apply rules or draw the grid click NEW RULES button
	2.1 Rules should be written in the following form rulesForLiving/rulesForDead. i.e. 23/3 that means in 
		order to survive cell needs 2 or 3 living neighbours and in order to become alive the dead cell needs 3 living neighbours.
	2.2 At any time you can change the rules during the use of program by modifying this text field and pressing NEW RULES button again.
	2.3 You need to make sure that rules are written in correct format or else the application will not work as expected.
3. Clicking start button starts the simulation.
	3.1 In order to stop it click this button once again. The whole grid will remain the same untill you press the start again or restart the program.
4. You can click on cells any time in order to change their mode (living/dead).
	By click and drag you will modify several cells at once.
5. The only way to clean the grid (make all dead) is to put 9/9 in the rules and apply them (probably other rules are also possible).
	By doing this all living cells will not be able to remain living any longer and this will dispell others from raising from the dead.
6. In order to quit use x sign at the top-right corner of window.

Thank you for reading this, now you could use the application correctly.
